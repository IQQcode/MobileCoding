    <string name="lorem_ipsum">Flow is a new virtual layout used to build a chain. When the chain runs out, it can wrap to the next line or even another part of the screen. This is useful when you are laying out multiple items in a chain, but you are not sure about the size of the container at runtime. You can use it to build a layout based on dynamic dimensions in the application (such as the width of the screen when rotating). `Flow` is a virtual layout. In `ConstraintLayout`, virtual layouts (`Virtual layouts`) participate in constraints and layout as the role of `virtual view group`, but they are not added to the view hierarchy as views, but only reference other views to assist They complete their respective layout functions in the layout system.</string>
